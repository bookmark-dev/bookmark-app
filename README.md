# Revature Project BookMark (p2)

## Mission Statement

BookMark is a booking and ticketing service that wants to connect small businesses and their clients. This is a common place where companies can create an event and customers can RSVP or buy tickets for them. We think this application should make it easy for our clients to organize and publicize their events. Customers who have liked a business will be notified about their events and from there it's simpleâ€¦ they will just 'Book' it and 'Mark' it on their calendar!
